# little-knight
A fast paced "dungeon crawler" written in JavaScript and based on Phaser 3.

This is my first project using [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3). I've made it in order to understand the basics of the framework so there's nothing incredible about it and the way I did things can't be the best one for everything, but I have tried to make it the more expendable possible and I hope it can helps beginners to speed up their projects.  

### What you can find
- A tiny but fast hero
- Zelda games inspired elements
- Multiple levels
- 3 unique weapons to find in chests
- Fantastic NPCs with one dialog line
- Loots (sometimes, a small potion)
- Multiple enemies (with the same dumb AI that could be easily changed)
- A Lordran type inspired boss
